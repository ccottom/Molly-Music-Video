# Music-Video1
This is an interactive music video for my song "Molly." The music software Ableton was used to create the song and the software After Effects was used to make the video. It uses Hydra to interact with the code. The rotation, color, invert, repeat and scale of the video can be altered by changing the numbers in the code.
